# PODNAME: git-subversive
# ABSTRACT: Export git to Subversion
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % git subversive update
 % git subversive set name value
 % git subversive unset name
 % git subversive show [ name ]
 % git subversive --help
 % git subversive --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE>: you almost certainly want C<git-svn>, not this.

This program allows you to export your git repository to a Subversion repository.
The problem with C<git-svn> is that it treats Subversion as the authoritative
source and you frequently have to rebase.  It is almost always what you want if
you are a git user in a Subversion environment.  We have the problem that for
management reasons we need a Subversion repository copy as as a backup, but
we do everything in C<git>.  This is a terrible idea, but I am doing it because
I have to.

In order to export commits to the Subversion repository with the correct
dates, you will need to add a C<pre-revprop-change> hook.  Basically put a 
C<sh> script in the hooks directory of your Subversion repository with the
name C<pre-revprop-change> hook with this content:

 #!/bin/sh
 REPOS="$1"
 REV="$2"
 USER="$3"
 PROPNAME="$4"
 ACTION="$5"
 
 if [ "$ACTION" = "M" -a "$PROPNAME" = "svn:log" ]; then exit 0; fi
 if [ "$ACTION" = "M" -a "$PROPNAME" = "svn:date" ]; then exit 0; fi
 
 echo "Changing revision properties other than svn:log is prohibited" >&2
 exit 1
